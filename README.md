# Create T3 App

## TODO

-   Extract pokemon card to component
-   Extract pokemon type to component
-   Create utils library for:
    -   formatting pokemon ID
    -   rendering pokemon types
-   Seems like it tries to render the images before having the pokemon ids so it makes a http request to `http://localhost:3001/_next/image?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/undefined.png&w=256&q=75`
